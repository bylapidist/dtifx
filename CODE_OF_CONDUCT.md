# DTIFx Community Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for everyone. Maintainers, users,
and contributors are expected to treat each other with respect and empathy. This policy outlines the
behaviour we encourage, the conduct we will not tolerate, and how we enforce these standards.

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in the DTIFx ecosystem a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards we uphold

### Positive behaviours

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing appreciation for the time and effort of contributors and maintainers.

### Unacceptable behaviours

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments in any form.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory remarks, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, including unwelcome sexual attention.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional context.

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue
trackers, pull request reviews, documentation contributions, and any project-affiliated
communication channels. It also applies when an individual officially represents the project in
public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, contact the maintainer team at
[hello@lapidist.net](mailto:hello@lapidist.net). Include as much detail as possible, such as
screenshots, timestamps, and links to relevant discussions. Reports will be handled confidentially.

## Enforcement

- Maintainers will review incidents promptly and confidentially.
- When addressing violations we will prioritise the safety and well-being of those affected.
- Corrective actions may include warnings, temporary or permanent bans from community spaces, or
  escalation to platform moderation.

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) version 2.1 with adjustments for DTIFx
community workflows.
