# Design tokens

Add your design token documents to this directory. The default configuration expects JSON files, but
you can adjust `dtifx.config.mjs` to accommodate YAML, design tool exports, or custom loaders.

When you opt into the sample data during `dtifx init`, this folder is populated with a reference
token set that demonstrates DTIF layers, groups, and metadata.
