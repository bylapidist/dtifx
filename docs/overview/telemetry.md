# Telemetry

Telemetry spans give observability into DTIFx pipelines. The runtime factory in `@dtifx/core`
provides consistent exporters that all hosts can share.

## Runtime factory

Use `createTelemetryRuntime(mode, options?)` to obtain a tracer and an `exportSpans()` hook.

```ts
import { createTelemetryRuntime } from '@dtifx/core/telemetry';

const telemetry = createTelemetryRuntime('stdout');

const span = telemetry.tracer.startSpan('example');
// …do work…
span.end();
await telemetry.exportSpans();
```

Modes:

- `none` – returns a no-op tracer; `exportSpans()` resolves immediately.
- `stdout` – streams spans using OpenTelemetry's `ConsoleSpanExporter`. Override the exporter with
  `options.traceExporter` when integrating with alternate transports.

If an exporter throws, the runtime logs a structured error through the supplied `options.logger`
(`JsonLineLogger`, `noopLogger`, or a custom implementation) and suppresses the exception to keep
the host process stable.

## Wiring spans to commands

CLI commands instantiate a telemetry runtime per invocation. Spans are named consistently so traces
remain searchable:

- `dtifx.cli.validate`, `dtifx.cli.generate`, `dtifx.cli.inspect`, and `dtifx.cli.watch.iteration`
  (with `dtifx.cli.watch.artifacts` events) for build workflows.
- `dtifx.cli.audit` for audit runs (with child spans such as `dtifx.cli.audit.build` when audits
  reuse the build runtime).
- Diff commands rely on diagnostics rather than spans. Wrap `runDiffSession` calls in custom spans
  when you need telemetry around comparisons.

Each pipeline stage creates a child span (for example `dtifx.pipeline.plan`,
`dtifx.pipeline.resolve`, `dtifx.pipeline.transform`). Event bus subscribers bridge domain events
into span attributes so the telemetry payload records token counts, formatter counts, duration
metrics, and failure conditions.

Commands call `exportSpans()` before exiting to ensure spans reach the configured sink even when the
process encounters an error. When using `watch`, spans are exported after each cycle so long-running
sessions still flush regularly.

## Diagnostics correlation

Telemetry metadata complements structured logging:

- Build and audit commands attach `createBuildStageLoggingSubscriber` or equivalent logging adapters
  so NDJSON entries include elapsed timings and event names.
- Diff commands emit diagnostics through ports exposed by `@dtifx/diff`. When `--json-logs` is set,
  the CLI switches to `JsonLineLogger`, which uses the same structured shape as telemetry exporters
  so traces and logs share identifiers.

## Custom instrumentation

When embedding DTIFx runtimes you can subscribe to the event bus directly or author bespoke
subscribers:

```ts
import * as build from '@dtifx/build';
import { InMemoryDomainEventBus } from '@dtifx/build';

const telemetry = createTelemetryRuntime('stdout');
const bus = new InMemoryDomainEventBus();
bus.subscribe(
  build.createBuildStageTelemetryEventSubscriber({
    getSpan: () => telemetry.tracer.startSpan('run'),
  }),
);
```

For diff sessions, pass a diagnostics port to `runDiffSession` and wrap it with telemetry spans if
you need per-event tracking. All ports accept optional hooks, so custom hosts can instrument without
patching core packages.
